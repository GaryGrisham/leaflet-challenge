# leaflet-challenge

I created a map using Leaflet that plotted earthquakes from my dataset based on longitude and latitude.  I created data markers that reflected the magnitude by the size (using circle circumference) and depth (using color).  Additional popups were provided to reveal information about the earthquake when the circles are clicked.  A legend explaining the color meaning was also included.
