Homework for Leaflet
The task of this homework was to visualize an earthquake data set using data from the USGS GeoJson Feed webpage using HTML, Plotly, and JavaScript.
There were two parts to this.  I chose the basic visualization and did not attempt level 2.  
I created a map using Leaflet that plotted earthquakes from my dataset based on longitude and latitude.  I created data markers that reflected the magnitude by the size (using circle circumference) and depth (using color).  Additional popups were provided to reveal information about the earthquake when the circles are clicked.  A legend explaining the color meaning was also included.  
The API key was submited with the homework and not included here.
